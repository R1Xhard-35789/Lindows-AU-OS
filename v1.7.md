Lindows AU - Release Version 1.7

Codename: "Heritage" Release Date: December 2025 Base Architecture: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
1. Project Philosophy

Lindows AU is designed specifically for the non-technical senior demographic ("Grandma"). It prioritizes familiarity over novelty, adhering to the "Right to Repair" ethos by extending the lifecycle of aging hardware.

    Zero Learning Curve: Leverages muscle memory from the Windows 95/98 era.

    Privacy First: Zero telemetry. No data collection.

    Safety: Immutable core system files where possible; "Vault" encryption methodology.

2. Desktop Environment & User Experience (UX)

The interface is a total conversion designed to mimic the utilitarian simplicity of Redmond's late-90s OS.

    DE: XFCE4 (Lightweight, stable, low resource usage).

    Theme Engine: Chicago95 (Total conversion).

        Components: GTK3/4 themes, XFWM4 window borders, Icon set, MS Sans Serif font replacement.

        Boot Sequence: Custom Plymouth theme (retro BIOS post screen aesthetic).

        Menu: Whiskermenu configured to replicate the classic "Start" menu hierarchy.

3. The "Try Before You Buy" Wrapper

To reduce installation anxiety, V1.7 includes a Windows-native virtualization wrapper.

    Mechanism: Portable QEMU (WHPX acceleration enabled).

    Function: Runs the ISO in a contained window on the user's existing Windows 10/11 desktop.

    Nag-Screen: A script inside the live environment detects virtualization (virt-what) and prompts the user: "This simulation is running slow. Install Lindows permanently to speed up your computer by 400%."

4. Installation & Partitioning Strategy (The "2/3rds Rule")

The installer (Calamares/Ubiquity modified) automates a complex dual-partition logic to ensure data safety and interoperability.

    BitLocker Check: Installer scans for encrypted NTFS volumes. If found, pauses and instructs user to decrypt via Windows first.

    The Shrink: Automatically resizes the existing Windows partition to the minimum safe size.

    The Split: The freed space is divided as follows:

        66% (System): Formatted EXT4. Contains Root (/), Home (/home), and Swap.

        33% (Shared Bridge): Formatted NTFS. Mounted as /mnt/transfer.

            Purpose: This creates a "Transfer Folder" visible to both Lindows and the old Windows installation, allowing Grandma to drag-and-drop photos between OSs without understanding file systems.

5. Security Protocols ("The Vault")

We utilize military-grade encryption disguised under user-friendly terminology.

    Technology: LUKS2 (Linux Unified Key Setup).

    User Terminology: "The Digital Vault."

    Key Management: The installer enforces a "Write it down" verification step. The user must type their password, then check a box confirming they have written it on physical paper before the "Install" button becomes active.

6. Hardware Compatibility

    Minimum Specs: Dual Core CPU (64-bit), 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage.

    Driver Support: Pre-packaged broadcom-sta-dkms and legacy Nvidia drivers (390xx/470xx) to support laptops from the 2012-2015 era.




The run_lindows_demo.bat script is just the ignition key; we need to put the engine (QEMU) in the car. Since we are targeting a "no-install" experience on Windows host machines, we need a portable QEMU build inside the windows_tools folder.

Required Directory Tree: Your USB root needs to look exactly like this for the script to execute correctly:
Plaintext

[USB_ROOT]
├── Lindows_AU_V1.7.iso          <-- The ISO we just uploaded
├── run_lindows_demo.bat         <-- The script we just uploaded
├── [DIR] windows_tools          <-- QEMU Binaries go here
│   ├── qemu-system-x86_64.exe   <-- The main executable
│   ├── qemu-img.exe             
│   ├── *.dll                    <-- All dependency DLLs (glib, pixman, etc.)
│   └── [DIR] share              <-- Bios/Firmware files (bios-256k.bin, etc.)

Technical Action Items:

    Download QEMU for Windows (64-bit): Grab the latest portable binaries (usually from the W64 builds).

    Strip the Fat: We don't need the other architecture emulators (arm, ppc). Keep only x86_64 and the necessary .dll files to keep the USB footprint small.

    Verify Pathing: The batch file command cd windows_tools followed by -cdrom ..\Lindows_AU_V1.7.iso confirms that the ISO must be in the root, one level up from the executable.
